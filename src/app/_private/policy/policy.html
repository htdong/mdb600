        <p><b>1. Use Rights</b></p>
        <p>
          1.1. License. Subject to the terms and any applicable restrictions
          in the Agreement, GKC hereby grants to Licensee a world-wide, nonexclusive,
          non-transferable and non-sublicensable right for its
          Authorized Users to use GKC Products solely for its internal business
          operations and in accordance with the Documentation and Order
          Form.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 Subscription. If GKC Products are ordered on a subscription
          basis, the right to access and use the GKC Products is valid only for
          the subscription period and in the quantities identified in an Order

          license key.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 External Use. GKC Products for which external use is
          permitted in the Documentation or Order Form, may be accessed and
          used by third parties authorized by Licensee or its Affiliates
          (“Authorized Third Parties”) provided that (i) Authorized Third Parties
          may only use GKC Products with information or data created or
          maintained by Licensee or its Affiliates incidental to their business
          relationship with each such Authorized Third Party; and (ii) such use
          is in accordance with the Documentation and Order Form. For the
          avoidance of doubt, external use is subject to the restrictions in

          GKC Products by Authorized Third Parties not in accordance with this
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.4. Use Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted by this
          Agreement, Licensee will not permit or authorize anyone to:
          1.4.1. copy, decompile, disassemble or reverse engineer or
          otherwise attempt to extract or derive the source code or any
          methods, algorithms or procedures from the Software, or modify,
          adapt, translate or create derivative works based upon the GKC
          Products except as otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law;
          1.4.2. transfer or reassign a named user license in such a manner
          that enables multiple users to share such license in excess of the
          authorized quantity of named user licenses;
          1.4.3. use, offer or otherwise exploit the GKC Products, whether or
          not for a fee, by acting in any way as an independent software vendor,
          application service provider, managed service provider (MSP), SaaS
          provider, service bureau system integrator, data provider, marketing
          service provider, or similar business model. Such usage is only
          permitted through a separate OEM, MSP, or other written agreement
          with GKC;
          1.4.4. use the GKC Products in any manner that competes with GKC,
          including but not limited to, benchmarking, collecting and publishing
          data or analysis relating to the performance of the GKC Products, or
          developing or marketing a product that is competitive with any GKC
          Product or service;
          1.4.5. remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notice
          from the GKC Products; or

        <p>
          1.5. Retention of Rights; Access and Security. The GKC
          Products provided hereunder are licensed, not sold. To the extent not
          expressly licensed to Licensee hereunder, GKC, its Affiliates, and their
          respective suppliers or licensors where applicable, reserve and retain
          all right, title and interest in and to the GKC Products and all intellectual
          property rights embodied therein, as well as all trademarks, service
          marks, product names and trade names of GKC and its Affiliates
          (collectively the “Marks”). Licensee shall maintain reasonable
          technical and procedural access controls and system security to
          safeguard the GKC Products and Documentation and shall be directly
          responsible for any violations of this Agreement by anyone that it or
          any of its Affiliates has allowed to access the GKC Products.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.6. Feedback. Licensee is not obligated to provide GKC with any
          suggestions or feedback about the GKC Products, but if Licensee
          elects to do so, GKC may use and modify this feedback for any
          purpose, including developing and improving the GKC Products,
          without any liability, restriction, or payment to Licensee.
        </p>

        <p><b>2. Maintenance and Services</b></p>
        <p>
          2.1. Maintenance and support for the GKC Products
          (“Maintenance”) will be made available to Licensee in accordance
          with GKC’s then-current Maintenance Policy (available at
          www.GKC.com/license-terms), subject to Licensee’s payment of the
          applicable fees for such services. Where Licensee receives
          Maintenance from a GKC-authorized reseller, such Maintenance will
          be provided pursuant to a separate written agreement between
          Licensee and the applicable reseller.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 Maintenance is included with paid subscriptions of GKC
          Products. For all other license types, Licensee is required to
          purchase Maintenance with its initial Software purchase for a
          minimum twelve-month period following the Delivery Date (the “Initial
          Maintenance Period”). Maintenance shall automatically renew at the
          end of the Initial Maintenance Period, and at the end of each
          subsequent period thereafter, unless Licensee provides GKC with
          written notice of non-renewal at least forty-five (45) days prior to the
          end of the then-current maintenance period. Maintenance fees for
          any renewal period are subject to increase, provided (i) GKC notifies
          Licensee of such fee increase at least sixty (60) days prior to the end
          of the then-current period; and (ii) the increase does not exceed five
          percent (5%) of the Maintenance fees for the then-current period.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3. GKC may provide Consulting Services to Licensee pursuant to
          a written Statement of Work, which scope shall be limited to
          implementation, configuration and Software enablement services
          provided on a time and materials basis. Licensee retains all right, title
          and interest in and to its proprietary data (“Licensee Data”), including
          all data that Licensee elects to integrate into the GKC Products or to
          display within a dashboard created with the Software. GKC retains all
          right, title and interest in and to the GKC Products and all deliverables
          resulting from performance of the Consulting Services, including all
          methodologies, designs, improvements to the GKC Products, and
          know how, but excluding any Licensee Data incorporated into any
          such deliverable. GKC hereby grants Licensee a non-exclusive
          license to use any deliverables or work product created hereunder in
          connection with Licensee’s authorized use of the GKC Products. Any
          Consulting Services purchased directly from GKC will be provided in
          accordance with this Agreement and the Consulting Services Terms
          available at www.GKC.com/license-terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 GKC may provide Education Services to Licensee in
          accordance with this Agreement and the Education Services Terms
          available at www.GKC.com/license-terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 If Licensee orders, activates or otherwise uses DataMarket,
          Web Connectors, GeoAnalytics or the Smart Analytics Adapter
          (collectively “Subscription Services”) which rely upon third party APIs
          or data, such use shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement
          and the subscription services addendum available at
          www.GKC.com/license-terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.6 GKC Products do not include Consulting or Education
          Services. Payment of fees for GKC Products shall not be contingent
          under any circumstances upon the performance of any Consulting or
          Education Services.
        </p>

        <p><b>3. Warranties and Disclaimers</b></p>
        <p>
          3.1. GKC warrants that the initial version of the Software delivered
          under this Agreement will, for a period of ninety (90) days from its
          Delivery Date (“Warranty Period”), operate substantially in conformity
          with its applicable Documentation. Licensee is deemed to have
          accepted the Software on the Delivery Date. Licensee must assert
          any claim for breach of this warranty within the Warranty Period.
          Licensee’s exclusive remedy and GKC’s sole liability with regard to any
          breach of this warranty will be, at GKC's option and expense, to either:
          (i) repair or replace the non-conforming Software; (ii) if the Software
          was obtained by purchase (and not as a result of a conversion from a
          previously purchased GKC Product), refund to Licensee the fees paid
          by Licensee for the non-conforming Software; or (iii) if the Software
          was obtained as a result of conversion from a previously purchased
          GKC Product, require the Software to be uninstalled by Licensee and
          reversion to the prior GKC Product.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2. If GKC elects to refund the applicable fee paid for the nonconforming
          Software pursuant to Section 3.1(ii), then: (i) Licensee
          shall promptly return or demonstrate to GKC’s reasonable satisfaction
          that it has destroyed the non-conforming Software and any other
          related materials provided by GKC; and (ii) the licenses for such nonconforming
          Software will automatically terminate.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.3. GKC will have no liability for any warranty claim, or any
          obligation to correct any defect or problem with the Software, to the
          extent that it arises out of: (i) any use of the Software not in
          accordance with the Documentation; (ii) any unauthorized
          modification or alteration of the Software; or (iii) any use of the
          Software in combination with any third-party software or hardware not
          specified in the Documentation.
          3.4. GKC warrants that Consulting Services will be performed using
          reasonable care and skill consistent with generally accepted industry
          standards. For any claimed breach of this warranty, Licensee must
          notify GKC of the warranty claim within ten (10) business days of
          Licensee’s receipt of the applicable Consulting Services. Licensee’s
          exclusive remedy and GKC’s sole liability with regard to any breach of
          this warranty will be, at GKC’s option and expense, to either: (i) reperform
          the non-conforming Consulting Services; or (ii) refund to
          Licensee the fees paid for the non-conforming Consulting Services.
          Licensee shall provide reasonable assistance to GKC in support of its
          efforts to furnish a remedy for any breach of this warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4. GKC warrants that Consulting Services will be performed using
          reasonable care and skill consistent with generally accepted industry
          standards. For any claimed breach of this warranty, Licensee must
          notify GKC of the warranty claim within ten (10) business days of
          Licensee’s receipt of the applicable Consulting Services. Licensee’s
          exclusive remedy and GKC’s sole liability with regard to any breach of
          this warranty will be, at GKC’s option and expense, to either: (i) reperform
          the non-conforming Consulting Services; or (ii) refund to
          Licensee the fees paid for the non-conforming Consulting Services.
          Licensee shall provide reasonable assistance to GKC in support of its
          efforts to furnish a remedy for any breach of this warranty.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN SECTIONS 3.1,
          AND 3.4, GKC MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE
          GKC PRODUCTS OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS
          AGREEMENT AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
          WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY,
          INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
          NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY
          QUALITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EVEN
          IF GKC HAS BEEN INFORMED OF SUCH PURPOSE). GKC DOES
          NOT WARRANT THAT THE GKC PRODUCTS WILL BE ENTIRELY
          FREE FROM DEFECTS OR OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR
          ERROR FREE.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6 If Licensee: (i) obtains GKC Products from GKCTech GmbH and
          designates an address in Austria or Germany on the Order Form, or
          (ii) obtains GKC Products from GKCTech Australia Pty Ltd and
          designates an address in Australia on the Order Form, then Sections
          3 and 5 of this Agreement shall be subject to the terms in Addendum
          1.
        </p>

        <p><b>4. Fees and Taxes.</b></p>
        <p>
          Licensee shall pay any fees due in accordance with the payment
          terms set forth in the Order Form or Statement of Work. Fees are not
          subject to any right of offset or suspension and all payments shall be
          non-cancelable, non-refundable and non-creditable, except as
          otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. Fees for Consulting
          or Education Services are exclusive of travel costs and other
          expenses. Fees for Maintenance are payable in advance. If
          applicable, fees for Maintenance and subscriptions may be prorated
          to the next billing period. Any proration will not relieve Licensee’s
          obligation for the total fees due for the full Initial Maintenance Period.
          Fees do not include sales, use, withholding, value-added or other
          taxes or duties. Licensee agrees to pay all applicable taxes, public
          fees, duties, deductions or withholdings for which GKC is required to
          pay or account, exclusive of any tax on GKC’s income. Licensee shall
          directly pay any such taxes or duties assessed against it, unless
          Licensee provides GKC in a timely manner with a valid certificate of
          exemption or other evidence that items are not taxable.
        </p>

        <p><b>5. Limitation of Liability</b></p>
        <p>
          5.1. Limitation of Liability. Except for: (i) death or bodily injury
        caused by a Party’s negligence; (ii) breach of Section 9.7; (iii) each
        Party’s indemnification obligations under this Agreement; and (iv)
        Licensee’s violation of GKC’s intellectual property rights, each Party’s
        maximum, cumulative liability for any claims, losses, costs (including
        attorney’s fees) and other damages arising under or related to this
        Agreement, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort
        (including but not limited to negligence or strict liability) or otherwise,
        will be limited to actual damages incurred, which will in no event
        exceed the greater of the amount of fees paid or payable by the
        Licensee attributable to the specific products or services giving rise to
        such damages or one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000).
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2. Exclusion of Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL GKC, ITS
        AFFILIATES, OR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE
        LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF SAVINGS, PROFITS OR REVENUES,
        LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA, GOODWILL, OR
        REPUTATION, INACCURACY OF ANY DATA, THE COST OF
        PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR
        SOFTWARE, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
        HOWSOEVER ARISING AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF
        LIABILITY (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY),
        EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE OR
        LOSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3. THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS
        CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE INDEPENDENT OF ANY
        AGREED REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND WILL
        APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
        LAW, EVEN IF ANY AGREED REMEDY IS FOUND TO HAVE
        FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. TO THE EXTENT THAT
        GKC MAY NOT, AS A MATTER OF LAW, DISCLAIM ANY
        WARRANTY OR LIMIT ITS LIABILITIES, THE SCOPE OR
        DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY AND THE EXTENT OF GKC’S
        LIABILITY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH
        LAW. IF A WAIVER, RIGHT, OR REMEDY IS EXERCISED
        PURSUANT TO MANDATORY LAW, IT SHALL BE EXERCISED
        SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE PROVIDED AND IN
        CONFORMANCE WITH THE PROCEDURES AND LIMITATIONS
        EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR BY SUCH LAW.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4. No Third Party Beneficiaries. The warranties and other
        obligations of GKC under this Agreement run only to, and for the sole
        benefit of Licensee, notwithstanding any rights to access or use the
        Software the Licensee may grant its Authorized Users or Authorized
        Third Parties. Except as otherwise mandated by applicable law, no
        other person or entity will be considered a third party beneficiary of
        this Agreement or otherwise entitled to receive or enforce any rights
        or remedies in relation to this Agreement.
        </p>

        <p><b>6. Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnification</b></p>
        <p>
          6.1. Indemnification. GKC shall indemnify, defend and hold
        harmless Licensee against any IP Claims, provided that Licensee (i)
        promptly notifies GKC in writing of such IP Claim; (ii) allows GKC to
        have sole control of the defense and any related settlement
        negotiations; and (iii) provides GKC with such information, authority
        and assistance necessary for the defense or settlement of the IP
        Claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2. Exceptions. GKC will not be liable for any IP Claim arising
        from or based upon: (i) any unauthorized use, reproduction or
        distribution of the Software; (ii) any modification or alteration of the
        Software without the prior written approval of GKC; (iii) use of the
        Software in combination with any other software or hardware not
        provided by GKC; (iv) use of a prior version of the Software, if use of a
        newer version of the Software would have avoided such claim and
        such newer version is made available without charge; or (v) any Third
        Party Materials provided with the Software.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 Remedies. If Software becomes, or, in GKC’s opinion, is likely
        to become, the subject of an IP Claim, GKC may, at its option and
        expense, either: (i) obtain the right for Licensee to continue using the
        Software in accordance with this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the
        Software so that it becomes non-infringing while retaining
        substantially similar functionality; or (iii) if neither of the foregoing
        remedies can be reasonably effected by GKC, terminate the license(s)
        for the subject Software (without need for a ruling by a court or
        arbitrator) and refund as applicable a pro rata portion of prepaid
        subscription fees, or license fees amortized over three (3) years on a
        straight-line basis, provided that such Software is returned to GKC
        promptly after the effective date of any such termination.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4 SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. THIS SECTION 6
        STATES GKC’S SOLE AND ENTIRE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY,
        AND LICENSEE’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
        RIGHT AND REMEDY, FOR INFRINGEMENT OR VIOLATION OF
        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
        </p>

        <p><b>7. Confidentiality</b></p>
        <p>
          Each Party will hold in confidence the other Party’s Confidential
        Information and will not disclose or use such Confidential Information
        except as necessary to exercise its express rights or perform its
        express obligations hereunder. Any Party’s disclosure of the other
        Party’s Confidential Information may be made only to those of its
        employees or consultants who need to know such information in
        connection herewith and who have agreed to maintain the
        Confidential Information as confidential as set forth herein.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may disclose the other Party’s
        Confidential Information to the extent that it is required to be disclosed
        in accordance with an order or requirement of a court, administrative
        agency or other governmental body, provided that such Party, to the
        extent permitted by law, provides the other Party with prompt notice
        of such order or requirement in order that it may seek a protective
        order. Each Party’s confidentiality obligations hereunder will continue
        for a period of five (5) years following any termination of this
        Agreement, provided, however, that each Party’s obligations will
        survive and continue in effect thereafter with respect to, and for so
        long as, any Confidential Information continues to be a trade secret
        under applicable law. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
        GKC Products and all pricing information shall be treated as the
        Confidential Information of GKC.
        </p>

        <p><b>8. Term and Termination</b></p>
        <p>
          8.1. Term. This Agreement shall become effective as of the date

        automatically upon expiration of all rights to use any GKC Products
        pursuant to one or more Order Forms. Unless otherwise specified in
        a Statement of Work, either Party may terminate any Consulting
        Services for convenience upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to
        the other Party.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2. Subscriptions shall automatically renew for successive
        additional periods equal to the initial subscription period unless either
        Party provides prior written notice of non-renewal to the other Party
        at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of the then-current
        subscription period. Subscriptions may not be cancelled in whole or
        in part during any subscription period. Upon renewal, subscription
        fees are subject to increase based on prevailing rates at the time of
        renewal. If the subscription is not renewed, Licensee’s right to access
        and use GKC Products shall cease at the end of the then-current
        subscription period, unless earlier terminated.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.3. Termination for Breach or Insolvency. Either Party may
        terminate this Agreement or any applicable Order Form, individual
        Software licenses, subscriptions or Statements of Work (without
        resort to court or other legal action) if the other Party: (i) fails to cure
        a material breach within thirty (30) days (ten (10) days in the case of
        non-payment by Licensee) after written notice of such breach,
        provided that GKC may terminate this Agreement immediately upon
        any breach of Section 1.4; (ii) terminates or suspends its business
        without a successor; (iii) becomes insolvent, admits in writing its
        inability to pay its debts as they become due, makes an assignment
        for the benefit of creditors, or becomes subject to control of a trustee,
        receiver or similar authority; or (iv) becomes subject to any bankruptcy
        or insolvency proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          8.4. Effect of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement
        or any GKC Product license, Licensee shall: (i) immediately cease
        using the applicable GKC Products, including the Software API and
        Documentation; and (ii) certify to GKC within thirty (30) days after
        expiration or termination that Licensee has destroyed or has returned
        to GKC all copies of the applicable Software, any associated license
        keys, the Documentation and all other GKC Confidential Information in
        its possession. Termination of this Agreement or any licenses shall
        not prevent either Party from pursuing all available legal remedies,
        nor shall such termination relieve Licensee’s obligation to pay all fees
        that are owed as of the effective date of termination. All provisions of
        this Agreement relating to GKC’s ownership of the GKC Products,
        limitations of liability, disclaimers of warranties, confidentiality (for the
        time periods specified in this Agreement), waiver, audit and governing
        law and jurisdiction, will survive the termination of this Agreement.

          Agreement or its rights and obligations hereunder in violation of this
          Section will be null and void. GKC is free to assign or transfer any or
          all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement at its discretion.

          jurisdiction in order to protect any urgent interest of such Party,
          including, but not limited to, the confidentiality and use restrictions of
          this Agreement. TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE UNDER

          AGREEMENT.

          any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this
          Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is
          due to unforeseen events, which occur after the effective date of this
          Agreement and which are beyond the reasonable control of the
          Parties, such as strikes, blockade, war, terrorism, riots, natural
          disasters, refusal of license by the government or other governmental
          agencies, in so far as such an event prevents or delays the affected
          Party from fulfilling its obligations and such Party is not able to prevent
          or remove the force majeure at reasonable cost.

        <p>
          9.12 Waiver. No term of this Agreement will be deemed waived
          and no breach excused unless such waiver or excuse shall be in
          writing and signed by the Party issuing the same. Neither this
          Agreement nor any Order Form shall be dependent on Licensee
          issuing a purchase order. Licensee acknowledges that any purchase
          order is for its administrative convenience only and that GKC has the
          right to issue an invoice and collect payment without a corresponding

        <p>
          9.13 Equitable Relief. Licensee acknowledges that GKC may be
          irreparably harmed by a breach of the terms of this Agreement and
          that damages, alone, may not be an adequate remedy. Licensee
          agrees that, in addition to any other rights or remedies permitted
          under applicable law, GKC will have the right to enforce this Agreement
          by injunctive or other equitable relief without the need to prove actual
          damages or post a bond.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.14 Limitation. Subject to applicable law, no action, regardless
          of form, arising out of this Agreement may be brought by Licensee
          more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.15 Entire Agreement; Severability; Language. This
          Agreement is the complete statement of the mutual understanding of
          the Parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral
          agreements and communications pertaining to the subject matter of
          this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court
          of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision
          will be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this
          Agreement will otherwise remain in force and effect. The English
          language version of this Agreement shall be the governing version
          used when interpreting or construing this Agreement.
