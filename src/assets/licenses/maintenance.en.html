	<b>2. Overview</b>
</p>
<p>
	2.1 GKC will provide Licensee with Maintenance Services and Support Services for the Software in accordance with this Policy and the level of coverage purchased by Licensee as well as any applicable terms in the agreement for the Software, subject to Licensee’s timely payment of the applicable Maintenance fees or subscription fees,
</p>
<p>
	2.2 Licensee is required to purchase Maintenance on all Software for a twelve (12) month period beginning on the delivery date of the Software (the "Initial Maintenance Period). In addition, Licensee must maintain a uniform level of Maintenance across all licenses or subscriptions within the same Software Family.
	In order to purchase additional Software licenses or subscriptions, Licensee must be current on Maintenance for all previously purchased licenses within the same Software Family.
	Licensee may elect to upgrade the level of Maintenance at any time during a Maintenance Period, but such upgrade must apply to all Software licensed with the same Software Family.
	In the event the Licensee elects not to renew Maintenance, the non-renewal must apply to all licenses or subscriptions within the same Software Family.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Software or subscriptions purchased as a bundle, package, or special promotion (e.g., enterprise licenses) must be maintained together at a uniform level, regardless of whether such Software or subscription purchase includes multiple Software Families, and cancellation of Maintenance by Software Family is not be permitted in such case.
</p>
<p>
	2.3 Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Maintenance shall be automatically renewed for successive twelve (12) month periods (each, a "Maintenance Period") unless Licensee provides GKC with written notice of non-renewal at least forty-five (45) days prior to the end of the-current annual period. Maintenance fees for any additional Software purchases will be prorated to achieve a common annual Maintenance Period with existing licenses, but does not relieve Licensee of its payment obligations for the remainder of the Maintenance Period.
	For avoidance of doubt, Licensee is responsible to pay the entire Maintenance Fee for the Initial Maintenance Period on all additional purchases of Software regardless of any proration of Maintenance Fees.
</p>
<p>
	2.4 Reinstatement of lapsed or cancelled Maintenance will be subject to payment by Licensee of (a) the then-current annual Maintenance Fees payable for the 12-month period beginning on the date of reinstatement and (b) the aggregate Maintenance Fees that would have been payable for the relevant Software during the period of lapse in the absence of termination or non-renewal, provided that (i) the combined reinstatement fees are paid within twelve (12) months after the date of the lapse and (ii) Licensee pays GKC a Maintenance reinstatement fee equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the total Maintenance fees payable to GKC for all applicable GKC products licensed by Licensee. Reinstatement beyond this date will be at GKC’s sole discretion. Reinstatement fees may be assessed once notice of cancellation or non-renewal is provided, even if a request for reinstatement is provided prior to the expiration of the current Maintenance Period.
</p>
<p>
	2.5 GKC may elect to make certain software publicly available under an open source license and free of charge on various online communities ("Extensions"). This Policy excludes Maintenance with regard to any Extensions. Support for Extensions is provided solely by the open source community. To the extent Extensions are used in connection with the Software, this Policy provides Maintenance for the Software and Software API only.
</p>
<p>
	2.6 GKC may elect to make certain software available free of charge for trial, evaluation or other purposes ("Freeware"). Maintenance for Freeware, if any, will be provided at GKC’s discretion and in accordance with the license terms for such Freeware.
</p>
<p>

GKC’s "Standard Business Hours" mean from 08:00 to 17:00, Monday to Friday (excluding national holidays).
</p>
<p>
	2.8 Any Support Services provided by GKC hereunder via telephone will be provided in the Vietnamese language. The availability of support provided in any language other than Vietnamese is provided at GKC’s sole discretion and is not guaranteed by GKC.

</p>
<p>
	3.2.3 Support Case Handling. Errors reported by Enterprise Support Licensees shall be given priority case handling in a designated priority support queue.
	Further, GKC will assist Enterprise Support Licensees in issue analysis to determine whether or not the technical issue is related to the third-party hardware or software.

</p>
<p>
	3.2.4 Update Information. Enterprise Support Licensees may contact GKC Enterprise Support for information regarding Updates performed by Licensee, such as installation instructions, release documentation, and general guidance for multiple environments.
</p>
<p>
	<b>4. Error Resolution and Escalation.</b>
</p>
<p>
	4.1 An Error is considered to be resolved upon the earlier to occur of the following: (i) GKC and Licensee mutually agree in writing (including via email) that the issue or problem is resolved; (ii) GKC has provided Licensee with an Update; (iii) GKC is able to provide a reasonable and mutually acceptable technical work-around solution; (iv) any of Licensee’s Technical Contacts requests that GKC close the support case; or (v) the support case has been left open for ten (10) consecutive business days, during which period GKC has not received a response from any of Licensee’s Technical Contacts.
</p>
<p>
	4.2 Exclusions. Notwithstanding anything in this Policy to the contrary, GKC will have no obligation to provide any Support Services in connection with: (i) any issue or problem that GKC determines is not due to any Error or deficiency in the Software (e.g., without limitation, issues or problems caused by stand-alone third party software products used in conjunction with the Software); (ii) any Errors or problems with the Software that are not reproducible; (iii) any Error or problem that is reported by Licensee via any GKC support telephone number or email address other than the one to which Licensee has been assigned on the Support Portal; or (iv) any Errors or problems with the Software that result from: (a) the use of the Software with software or hardware not designed for use with the operating systems approved by GKC in the Documentation; (b) the use of the Software with hardware that does not satisfy the minimum system requirements specified by GKC in the Documentation; (c) changes, modifications, or alterations to the Software not approved in writing by GKC or its authorized representatives; (d) use of the Software other than in accordance with the Documentation and the Agreement; (e) use of other than a Supported Version of the Software; or (f) Software provided on an evaluation basis or for which Licensee has not paid any maintenance fees. If GKC does correct any of the Errors described in subsections (a)-(f) above, or otherwise provides support for Software that is not covered by the terms and conditions contained in this Policy, such Error resolution or Software support will be provided only following Licensee’s written request and approval of all charges, and Licensee will be invoiced for such support at GKC’s then-current "time and materials" rates for such services. Without limiting any of the foregoing, GKC has no obligation to provide support for any third party software, data, or other materials distributed or bundled with the Software. Licensee may elect to purchase Extended Maintenance services on certain non-Supported Versions of the Software by entering into an agreement with GKC.
</p>
<p>
	4.3 If any Licensee (i) believes that GKC has failed to meet any of the response and/or communication frequency time frames with respect to any Errors reported to it in accordance with Sections 3.1.2 or 3.2.2, as applicable, or (ii) feels that the quality of the Support Services provided to Licensee by GKC is not satisfactory, then GKC encourages such Licensee to escalate the problem to the appropriate level of GKC management as follows:

<p>
	GKC recommends that Licensee-initiated escalation begin at the regional support manager level and proceed upward, using the escalation guidelines shown above for reference, if the actions described in the foregoing chart are not taken to Licensee’s reasonable satisfaction within the applicable timeframes.
</p>
<p>
	<b>5. Designated Support Engineer</b>
</p>
<p>
	5.1 Subject to Licensee’s timely payment of the applicable DSE fees, and provided that Licensee has purchased Enterprise Support and is current on all Maintenance Fees, then GKC shall provide the following DSE Services for up to four (4) Licensee Technical Contacts:
</p>
<p>
	• Direct access to a Designated Support Engineer with knowledge of Licensee’s environment
	• Service Implementation Plan
	• Fast-track into R&D for critical bugs
	• Weekly Progress Call
	• Quarterly on-site visits and service reviews
	• Access to beta releases
</p>
<p>
	5.2 DSE Services are supplemental to Support Services, and are not available as a stand-alone service. The term of the DSE Services	shall be for a period of twelve (12) months, commencing on the date that the DSE is assigned to Licensee ("DSE Services Commencement Date"), provided, however, that the DSE Services shall automatically terminate in the event that Support Services are not renewed by Licensee or are otherwise terminated. Provided that Licensee is enrolled in Enterprise Support at the time, Licensee may renew DSE Services upon payment of the applicable DSE fees. For avoidance of doubt, DSE Services are only available for Licensees who are current on Enterprise Support (and for Licensees with existing DSE Services who continue to renew). DSE Services are provided as a part of Maintenance pursuant to this Policy, and not as a consulting service.
</p>
<p>
	<b>6. Updates</b>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>

The maximum number of Technical Contacts for each Licensee is three (3) for Basic Support Coverage, six (6) for Enterprise Support Coverage, and four (4) for DSE Service, regardless of the number or types or quantities of licenses purchased for the Software. Licensee shall ensure that its Technical Contacts comply with any reasonable training requirements for the Technical Contact(s) upon notification by GKC. Subject to the previous sentence, Licensee may change its Technical Contact(s) by notifying GKC in writing.
</p>
<p>
	7.3 Upon reasonable request by GKC, Licensee shall provide GKC a detailed description of its IT system(s) within which the Software operates, together with the basic structure of that system, any operational disruption experienced by Licensee, and the effect of the disruptions on Licensee’s operations.

Licensee will not refer any third party, including without limitation, any of its contractors, authorized end users or any Authorized Affiliate to GKC for support of Software.
</p>
<p>
	7.6 GKC supports designated operating systems, not specific hardware configurations. If Licensee is running the Software on a virtual environment, Licensee and the virtual environment vendor will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the hardware or operating system layer as a result of the use of a virtual environment. GKC reserves the right to request Licensees to diagnose certain issues in a native designated operating system environment, operating without the virtual environment, as needed to determine whether the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.
</p>
<p>
	7.7 For certain services provided under this Policy, the transmission of machine logs may be required. For avoidance of doubt, Licensee shall not include any business sensitive and/or personal information via such transmissions. Accordingly, GKC shall not be deemed a Data Processor. However, should Licensee send to GKC any log files or other information containing personal data, GKC will (i) comply with relevant national enacting legislation in relation to its treatment of that personal data as required under relevant, applicable law; and (ii) in accordance with GKC’s privacy policies from time to time in effect. Licensee shall take reasonable measures to limit the amount and sensitivity of such data provided to GKC (by anonymization, for example).
</p>
<p>
	<b>8. Changes to Policy</b>
